Media File --> Media Identifier --> Media Reader

Media Identifier identifies the type of media file to be read.
It may use the file extension as a hint, but it cannot depend only on that
because file extensions can be easily renamed.

Once a media file is identified it can then be read.

The application will have a list of media identifiers. As a media file is
passed, the media identifiers will be examined to find the first one that can
identify the file. For a pluggable design, it should be possible to add
additional media identifiers.
